The following are solutions to Advent of Code 2024. They're mostly written in [Uiua](https://www.uiua.org/), which is a stack-based, array-oriented langauge. I'm just having fun because I'm pretty bad at it, but we'll learn more with time. üëç

## Goals
1. Try to solve all problems in Uiua while learning the language. Will default to Python of JavaScript if I can't figure it out.
2. Not going for speed but I intend to solve all problems.
